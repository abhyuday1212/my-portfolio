========== ABOUT ==========
<p class="about__description">
                  At the core of my expertise lies the mastery of crafting elegant and user-friendly web interfaces.
                  Driven by an
                  insatiable curiosity, my journey has propelled me to the forefront of complex challenges and
                  analytical thinking. While
                  my foundations are firmly rooted in the front-end landscape, Iâ€™m presently immersed in the depths of
                  back-end
                  development.
